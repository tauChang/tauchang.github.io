About Me
======
Hi! I'm Tzu-Tao (Tommy) Chang (張子濤). I'm a 4th-year CS Ph.D. student at UW-Madison, advised by Prof. [Shivaram Venkataraman](https://shivaram.org/). My research interests lie in ML systems, cloud systems, and cluster scheduling. 

Before joining UW-Madison, I received my B.A. in Finance and minor in Computer Science and Information Engineering from National Taiwan University, where I was advised by Prof. [Chung-Wei Lin](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cwlin/). 

I have a lovely dog named Coffee :)
